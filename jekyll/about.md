On my path of becoming a better web developer, learning about various topics I found one big issue: A lot of topics I'd like to learn about are either not explained well or explained for developers with a lot of background knowledge.

This website is an attempt to offer tutorials and guides explaining topics for people like me - who don't come from a computer science background but are excited about web development and want to learn everything there is to know about it.
